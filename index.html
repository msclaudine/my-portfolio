         <p>Now someone would wonder why i here in wecode; I have seen programming for my first time when i was in universty,
           i found it to be very very complicated from that time i have used to hate programming very deply. 
           So after university school i found there is many opportunities for the programmers,so after one year 
           i feel that i want to do it but fear of programming still there. when i hearded about wecode  i told my self maybe it is my time to experience new challenges and learn new things. 
           from that i decided to take this opportinity as a new chace to know what i have be afraid  for long  with  <strong>desire to become a programmer by proffessional</strong>
           And <span style=color:blue>provide solution to society</span>.</p>
